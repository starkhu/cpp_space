# f-string
python3.6引进的语法
我理解是format()函数的升级版。
官网解释：
```
Format strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces {}. Anything that is not
contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you
need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {undefined{ and }}.
```
